"soil_A": "Low drainage potential. Even if saturated, the soil has a high rate of infiltration. Deep, well-drained soil of moderate texture (sand, deep river bed). The loss rate for the soil group is between 7,5 and 11,5 mm / h.",
"soil_B": "Average to low drain potential. The earth, if saturated, has an average rate of water infiltration. Shallow river beds, sandy loam with moderate permeability. The loss rate for the soil group is between 3,85 and 7,5 mm / h.",
"soil_C": "High to moderate drainage potential. Soil, if saturated, has a low water infiltration rate. Clay loam, shallow sandy loam, soil with low organic matter content and soil with typically high clay content. The loss rate for the soil group is between 1,3 and 3,85 mm / h.",
"soil_D": "High drainage potential. The earth, if saturated, has a very low water infiltration rate. Lands with a high surface water level, with a clay layer or an impermeable layer on the surface or just below the surface, covered land, etc. Soil has a very low throughput. The loss rate for the soil group is between 0,00 and 1,3 mm / h."
